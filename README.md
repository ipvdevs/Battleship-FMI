# Battleship-FMI
A console Battleship game - project for my 
introduction to programming (practicum) course.

## Important
To compile the project successfully you should include and compile all the .cpp files.
g++ main.cpp ./board/*.cpp ./game/*.cpp ./preload/*.cpp

## Description
This is a simple console Battleship game I made for my practicum course.
I haven't used object oriented programming principles because I wanted
to create it just with the knowledge I got in the terms of the course and
keep it as simple as possible but still with validations, interesting features
and intuitive user interface.
I might rework it in the future which would be a great progress tracking.

## Getting Started
The console application is currently working with all its features in
the default Windows command-line interpreter (cmd).
