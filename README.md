# Battleship-FMI
A console Battleship game - project for my 
introduction to programming (practicum) course.

## Description
This is a simple console Battleship game I made for my practicum course.
I haven't used object oriented programming principles because I wanted
to create it just with the knowledge I got in the terms of the course and
keep it as simple as possible but still with validations, interesting features
and intuitive user interface.
I haven't also used external libraries except for *iostream*.
I might rework it in the future which would be a great progress tracking.

## Getting Started
The console application is currently working with all its features in
the default Windows command-line interpreter (cmd).

## Setup
